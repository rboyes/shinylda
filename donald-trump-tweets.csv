While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.,07-25-2016 21:33:49
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War.,07-25-2016 21:32:59

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA,07-25-2016 14:05:27
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!,07-25-2016 14:01:25
Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!,07-25-2016 13:47:45
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!,07-25-2016 13:42:55
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie.,07-25-2016 13:19:18
If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.,07-25-2016 12:27:35
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam,07-25-2016 12:26:56
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!,07-25-2016 12:02:01
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!,07-25-2016 11:57:17
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes me,07-25-2016 11:31:22
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS  and  all others laughing!,07-24-2016 23:59:10
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!,07-24-2016 23:47:08
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she's out!,07-24-2016 22:33:42
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive  and  well!,07-24-2016 22:16:59
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!,07-24-2016 22:07:49
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out,07-24-2016 22:02:42
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wild,07-24-2016 21:53:29
The @CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!,07-24-2016 20:45:31
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!,07-24-2016 20:30:06
Today proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.),07-24-2016 20:20:57
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!,07-24-2016 13:30:59
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!,07-24-2016 13:27:56
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.,07-24-2016 12:30:15
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!,07-24-2016 12:15:51
Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!,07-24-2016 11:56:43
Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT,07-24-2016 11:25:06
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!,07-24-2016 11:16:15

The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!,07-23-2016 21:20:58
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!,07-23-2016 20:43:33
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!,07-23-2016 16:06:15
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!,07-23-2016 15:36:41
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!,07-23-2016 15:01:48
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.,07-23-2016 14:51:32
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED,07-23-2016 10:55:20
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!,07-23-2016 10:42:10
Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!,07-23-2016 10:35:37

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.,07-06-2016 14:01:09
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.,07-06-2016 13:24:50
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City,07-06-2016 13:12:43
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.,07-06-2016 13:08:44

Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information." Not fit!,07-06-2016 11:12:45
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!,07-06-2016 04:36:31
I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8 she's out!,07-06-2016 04:30:04

On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy!,07-04-2016 22:59:46
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?,07-04-2016 22:30:15
With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!,07-04-2016 15:34:15
Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33000 missing e-mails?,07-04-2016 15:26:56

The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!,07-04-2016 11:54:40

I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!,07-03-2016 21:46:58
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away no pictures.",07-03-2016 21:43:25
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?,07-03-2016 21:38:20

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged  and  corrupt!,07-03-2016 20:20:20
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.,07-03-2016 20:16:23
Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against me.The good news-the people get it!,07-03-2016 17:40:49
It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!,07-02-2016 21:13:02
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!,07-02-2016 20:39:39

The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!,06-30-2016 19:29:48

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about  and  demeaning? https://t.co/rYGX9vazku,01-16-2016 19:39:31
Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul  and  $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite,01-16-2016 19:32:40

Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form  and  not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St,01-16-2016 18:26:54
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.,01-16-2016 18:23:26
Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!,01-16-2016 18:22:40
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?,01-16-2016 18:21:03
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes. https://t.co/hxdfy0mjVw,01-16-2016 16:11:28

Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!,01-16-2016 13:31:10
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian" did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?,01-16-2016 12:23:00
Oh no just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan this one from Citi. Wow no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.,01-16-2016 12:17:32
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember his wife's employer and his lender is located there!,01-16-2016 12:12:45
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!,01-16-2016 11:52:46
Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable,01-16-2016 11:49:02
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so,01-16-2016 11:40:13
